Certificates for `*.local-tests.dev`.

The subdomains on `local-tests.dev` are pre-configured to be resolved to local IP addresses, for example
- localhost.local-tests.dev --> 127.0.0.1
- ip-192-168-88-1.local-tests.dev --> 192.168.88.1
etc.

You can download the certificates and config to your own server(Nginx, SpringBoot, etc) to help you to debug your application/services.
